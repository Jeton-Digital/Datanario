# Datanario
Datanario is a platform where people can communicate, collaborate and grow together.

Datanario is the name of a data-driven scenario. If a scenario can be explained with data-driven figures and graphs, then it is not a scenario anymore but a datanario. So, in a nutshell, datanario is a new term for these kinds of scenarios.
